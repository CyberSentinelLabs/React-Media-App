# C.S. Media App
This is a React application that demonstrates routing, file validation, and media recording features. It is built to be a simple, self-contained starting point for your larger project.

## Features
Client-side Routing: Uses 'useState' to switch between different "pages" without a page reload.

File Upload Validation: Checks for valid file types '(.wav, .flac, etc.)' and size limits (50KB to 50MB).

Media Recording: Includes buttons to trigger permission requests for both audio-only and video+audio recording.

State Management: Utilizes React's Context API for simple, shared state.

UI: Styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive design.

How to use this code
Create a new React project using npx create-react-app my-app or a similar tool.

Navigate to the src folder in your project.

Replace the contents of your App.jsx with the code from the generated file.

Run npm start to see the application in your browser.
